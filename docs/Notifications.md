There are three types of notifications supported by Blogifier. They all listed and maintained
in the admin under `admin/notifications`, along with newsletter subscriptions.
All notifications require admin access.

### System notifications
Notifications posted by the system, for example when new release is available. These are
pull notifications, Blogifier calls external site (`github`) to check for system notifications.

### User notificatoins
Right now mostly a placeholder. When implemented will allow blog users send messages to
each other.

### Contact notificatoins
Notifications submitted by "contact us" form, if theme supports this.
